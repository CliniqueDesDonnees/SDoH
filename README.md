# 🏥 SDOH Extraction from French Clinical Notes using Flan-T5-Large

## 📌 Overview

A sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) approach for extracting **Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)** from **French clinical notes** using the [Flan-T5-Large](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-large) language model. A total of 13 SDoH categories is included in this study: living condition, marital status, descendants, employment status, occupation, tobacco use, alcohol use, drug use, housing, education, physical activity, income, and ethnicity/country of birth.

Description of the method and results are available in our paper: [Improving Social Determinants of Health Documentation in French EHRs Using Large Language Models](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-large)

This repository contains resources to reproduce our implementation: annotated corpora, annotation guidelines, and scripts for inter-annotator agreement computation, and model fine-tuning and evaluation.

## 📂 Available Datasets

### 📚 Sources

- **MUSCADET-Synthetic**: Synthetic social history sections written by a physician.
- **UW-FrenchSDOH**: French-translated social history sections from the University of Washington SDOH dataset, originally derived from MTSamples.

All datasets are distributed under the CC BY-NC 4.0 licence and stored in BRAT format in `annotation/data/`.

### 📝 Annotation

- **Format:** [BRAT standoff format](http://brat.nlplab.org/standoff.html)
- **Schema:** Entities covering 13 SDoH categories (living condition, marital status, descendants, employment status, occupation, tobacco use, alcohol use, drug use, housing, education, physical activity, income, and ethnicity/country of birth) and 6 relations (Status, Amount, Duration, Frequency, History, Type).
- **Tooling:** See `annotation/annotation_scheme/` for BRAT configuration files.
